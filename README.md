 User Roles:
 - Artist
 - Doners
 - Platform Admin 

Functionality-wise; 
- An artist can list their art with the duration of crowdfunding.
- Admin can approve art projects listed by the artists after successful verification.
- Users can fund those projects, vote on the milestones, and get a refund if 100% funding is not attained for a project listing. 

There is something more to it! Users can view the past funding raised and their status. Users can also act as an artist and list their creations.
